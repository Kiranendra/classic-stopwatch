Classic Stopwatch

This is a stopwatch desktop application developed using "tkinter" in python. The timer starts efficiently. The start button and reset button works fine. 

But, to stop the timer the stop button has to be "clicked" -> more than 3 times continuously.

To start the timer, download the application (.exe) file and double click it.
